# Beatport Notifier
## Get an email notification when a selected album is uploaded to Beatport

It gives you an email when a new album is uploaded from selected labels in the config file. If it finds something it gives you an email and the program closes, and if you put it in the task scheduler the next day will be up again, if it finds nothing the program will sleep for 5h until a new check. 

Just modify the config file and the startBatch with your own configuration and add run.vbs to Windows task scheduler to run the script at startup.
